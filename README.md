```json
{
  "GET /members": {
    "desc": "returns all members",
    "response": "200 application/json",
    "data": [{}, {}, {}]
  },

  "GET /members/:id": {
    "desc": "returns one member respresented by its id",
    "response": "200 application/json",
    "data": {}
  },

  "POST /members": {
    "desc": "create and returns a new member uisng the posted object as the member",
    "response": "201 application/json",
    "data": {}
  },

  "PUT /members/:id": {
    "desc": "updates and returns the matching member with the posted update object",
    "response": "200 application/json",
    "data": {}
  },

  "DELETE /members/:id": {
    "desc": "deletes and returns the matching member",
    "response": "200 application/json",
    "data": {}
  }
}
```

  id: '1',
  age: 57,
